In this blog post, we show how you can leverage SageMaker Pipelines and SageMaker MultiModel Endpoints to build and deploy many such models.</p>

Through the common file share, clinicians and data scientists can collaborate on the same data sets through different tools that they are familiar with. 
Amazon AppStream 2.0 is used to stream an image computing platform, named 3D Slicer for interactive medical image annotation for clinicians.</p>
